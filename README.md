Titanik_Logistic_Regression_model
A machine learning model that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using logistic regression.

Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, class, and fare. Logistic regression is employed as the modeling technique due to its suitability for binary classification problems.

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanik_Logistic_Regression_model.git

Create a virtual environment:

Bash
python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

Bash
venv\Scripts\activate   
  # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

Install dependencies:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Prepare the data: Ensure you have the Titanic dataset (e.g., in CSV format) in the data directory.
Run the model:
Bash
python titanic_model.py

Model Explanation
The model is trained on the Titanic dataset, using the following features as predictors:

Age: Age of the passenger.
Sex: Gender of the passenger (male or female).
Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Fare: Passenger fare.
The logistic regression model is then fitted to the data, and the learned coefficients are used to predict survival probabilities for new passengers.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify survivors and non-survivors.   

Future Improvements
Feature engineering: Explore additional features that might improve predictive accuracy.
Hyperparameter tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
Ensemble methods: Consider combining multiple models (e.g., using random forests or gradient boosting) to enhance prediction capabilities.# Titanik_Logistic_Regression_model
